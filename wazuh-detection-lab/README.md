# wazuh-detection-lab

Wazuh detection lab for simulating and detecting suspicious activity on Windows endpoints using Wazuh and Sysmon.



\#  Wazuh Detection Lab



This project simulates real-world attacks inside a Windows VM and uses \*\*Wazuh\*\* to detect and alert on suspicious behavior. Built as a hands-on cybersecurity detection lab to demonstrate skills in SOC monitoring, host-based intrusion detection, and threat hunting.



\##  Project Goals



\- Set up a working Wazuh environment (Ubuntu server + Windows agent)

\- Simulate common attack techniques (e.g., failed logins, PowerShell abuse)

\- Detect and document alerts generated by Wazuh

\- Showcase logs, alerts, and detection rules for each scenario
