\# Attack #1: Brute-force Login Simulation



\## Overview



This simulation mimics a brute-force attack by generating multiple failed login attempts on the Windows agent. Wazuh should detect this activity and generate alerts related to authentication failures.



---



\## Simulation Steps



1\. \*\*On the Windows Agent VM\*\*, open PowerShell.

2\. Run the following command to simulate failed logins:



```powershell

for ($i=0; $i -lt 10; $i++) {

&nbsp;   net use \\\\localhost\\IPC$ /user:fakeuser wrongpassword

}

This will generate failed login attempts by trying to authenticate with invalid credentials.
